##Duplicate File Finder (DFF)
###Description

Duplicate File Finder (DFF) is a Python-based command-line utility designed to efficiently identify and manage duplicate files within a specified set of directories. Utilizing the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, DFF ensures accurate detection by comparing file contents rather than just file sizes, which provides a more reliable identification of duplicates.

The utility offers a user-friendly interactive prompt, allowing users to review and manage detected duplicates. Users can delete duplicates individually or in bulk, examine the content of the files, or open files using a specified command. With customizable command-line arguments, DFF provides flexibility to cater to different user needs, including minimum file size consideration and symlink following.
